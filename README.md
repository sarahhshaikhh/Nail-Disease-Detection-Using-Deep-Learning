# Nail Disease Detection using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based system that classifies nail disease images with high accuracy. This tool aims to assist dermatologists and individuals in detecting nail diseases by simply uploading an image.

# Overview
This project aims to classify nail images into six categories using a Convolutional Neural Network based on the MobileNetV2 architecture. The system can assist dermatologists or individuals in identifying nail diseases by simply uploading an image.

# 🔬 Classes Detected:
- Acral Lentiginous Melanoma
- Blue Finger
- Clubbing
- Healthy Nail
- Onychogryphosis
- Pitting

# 📂 Dataset & Preprocessing
The dataset includes labeled nail images across six disease categories.
Images were preprocessed for enhanced feature extraction.
Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization:

- Rotation
- Scaling
- Shearing
- Zooming
- Horizontal Flipping
